Elizabeth (Priscilla Shirer) has a good career in real estate. Along with good jobs, they have a nice house and a beautiful daughter. Beneath the surface, however, their marriage is in trouble. The relationship is steeped in distrust and disloyalty. Tony keeps Elizabeth in the dark about what is happening in his life, which leads to Elizabeth having feelings of anger, bitterness, and resentment.</p><p>While the marriage is in a severe strain, Elizabeth meets a new client, Miss Clara, a quirky elderly woman who speaks her mind. Their meeting is what changes Elizabeth’s life. Miss Clara introduces Elizabeth to her “war room,” which is a prayer closet. Miss Clara teaches Elizabeth how to pray in the war room and how to bring her troubles to the Lord God. </p><p>Elizabeth feels hopeless. She has been trying to keep her marriage and her family together on her own strength. When she meets Miss Clara, she learns how to rely on God’s strength. Like Jesus’ example from the Bible, Miss Clara shows Elizabeth new wineskins to pour her marriage into, instead of the old wineskins that she was using. Elizabeth thinks that she is going to help a new client put her house up for sale, but instead, her client helps her get a renewed marriage. Once Elizabeth starts to pray, her life and her marriage are turned upside down.</p><p>The term “repent” is used in this film, but not really explained. What is repentance?</p><p>What is regeneration?</p><p>I think that people need to watch this film. It does not show God as a fairy godmother or Santa Claus. It shows that hope is found in prayer and trusting and believing God and His Word. The movie tells us that despite the fact that situations seem really dark and gloomy, if we trust God to take care of the circumstance, He will bring us to the other side with joy and hope.</p><p>Scenes in this movie that may be of concern to some: </p><ol><li><p>There is a scene where one spouse desires to commit adultery. </p></li><li><p>In the same scene, the spouse drinks alcohol.</p></li><li><p>There is a scene about lying, dishonesty, and stealing.</p></li></ol><p>There is no violence, nudity or profanity. It is very family-oriented, but some subjects, like the possibility of adultery, may not be appropriate for children under ten years old. As believers, I feel strongly that we need to support Christian films in order to make a statement to Hollywood. It is a decent film, telling us how to use an important tool in the Christian life: prayer.</p><p>Violence: Mild / Language: Mild / Sex/Nudity: Mild</p><p>Update, 8.28.2015: Now that the movie is out, I have a surprise for you. I saw a screening of this movie months ago. I learned that the actress who plays Miss Clara is a younger woman. She is not elderly at all. She came into the audition dressed as the character and won the part. I think that’s what makes this movie more interesting. She amazed the directors and producers with this performance. I hope that it amazed you, too!</p><p>See list of Relevant Issues—questions-and-answers.</p><img src='https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91l-lVL6gdL.jpg' alt='Warroom 3 1 2 commentary youtube' title='Warroom 3 1 2 commentary youtube' /><br /><div><span>Positive</span>—I am absolutely… speechless. I have seen many of the Kendrick brothers’ films, “Courageous,” “Facing the Giants.” But never have I seen a movie so powerful and so uplifting since “God’s Not Dead.” Powerful performances (some even humorous) and a true, straightforward message about the power of prayer and the patience that comes through prayer. As I sat in the theater, I couldn’t help but overhear people praising God over and over. <br />Without giving too much away, all the emotional strings were pulled in this movie: joy, anger, sadness. Two hours later, I’m still in awe of how amazing this film was. I wish this movie was available for viewing in more theaters (only ONE theater in my area, out of dozens, was showing this). If it’s in your area and you only go to one movie this year, this is IT. Tell your friends, tell your neighbors! I can’t wait for the DVD release!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This is an outstanding movie.

I found the movie to be inspirational, steady moving and really enjoyable. I loved the jump rope competition. Some very cool moves! My favorite part was the end—a call for God to lift up a generation of warriors who will fight on their knees. We need it bad.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Great movie and a very timely one.

I would not have a concern, except for the youngest of children, because of the issues the reviewer brought up about adultery, alcohol, etc… I really liked the way Miss Clara was an enthusiastic follower of Jesus, and her dedication to prayer wasn’t made light of by the directors—but it was not, it was respected and to be admired. It is always nice seeing characters from other Kendrick movies make an appearance—not sure why Beth Moore was on the movie poster when she had really two sentences of dialog, and it was not a profound turning point in the movie. <br />I did like the way the subject of prayer was dealt with BUT most specifically, Miss Clara’s teaching on GRACE. It was spot on and was one of the most powerful lessons of the movie. Felt the ending was somewhat rushed—but loved the lessons of why prayer was needed, the importance, and the humble submission to Jesus in prayer—a recognition of our daily need for grace and strengthening—they were perfect. GO SEE THIS! With your spouse, a possible spouse, and friends. GO!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Ok, we all need a Miss Clara in our lives. This Miss Clara will inspire you to be serious about your prayer life. This movie was totally inspiring and one of the best Christian movies in a bit. With great music from Mandisa, Toby Mac, Building 429, John Waller, Steve C. Chapman and more. <br />I cannot say enough. Churches, see this movie—and start praying.

I attended this movie on opening night with my wife and disciples from my church. What a blessing!! We were all encouraged to take serious spiritual inventory of ourselves. We were challenged to intercede for others and mentor others in their journey of prayer and holy living. <br />The characters were authentic and believable. I saw myself in the film! It was inspiring to participate in the worship experience of watching the film. We cried, prayed, laughed, shouted and praised Jesus for His amazing grace!! I recommend this film to all people, both believers and unbelievers. The prayers of the righteous are powerfully effective!!!… <span>I commend the Kendrick Brothers and their vision in knowing what the body of Christ needs at this time… a call to prayer!!!</span><br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Karen Abercrombie [Miss Clara] is just absolutely amazing.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This movie is a wake up call to America for a revival!

Awesome job guys for a job well done!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Just watched this on opening night. As expected, it was a blessing to watch and be challenged in the faith in the area of prayer. This film follows a lot of the same main story points as the previous films, which is a good thing—like the 4 Gospels. I pray they stick to this format. <br />BTW, I challenge you to go back and watch the other films, especially if you have never seen them: “Flywheel,” “Facing the Giants,” “Fireproof” and “Courageous.” Good story telling, entertaining, funny, inspiring and convicting. My wife and I prayed in the car after the movie. My only complaint about this movie would be that it doesn’t have the action and intensity of the previous films. <span>I pray this film stirs up Christians to be serious about their prayer lives</span>. May God also draw people who don’t know the God of the Bible to see and be saved.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—I think this is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The actors and story line was incredible.

Great acting by all. Great script and production. Best Christian film and best movie in general in a LONG time. Laugh out loud many times. Moving portrayals by the mother and father. Some of the most profound moments are comedian Michael Jr. speaking the truth with love to the father and Miss Clara mentoring the mother. The daughter and her friend add so much with their expressions. Excellent cast. Excellent film.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Another well done movie from the Kendrick Brothers. The storyline is relevant to many issues in our society today and shows how we can become distracted by worldly pursuits, rather than focusing on our relationship with God. This movie inspired me to pray about everything in my life, challenged me to release my battles to the Lord and <span>encouraged me to be diligent and faithful in my prayers for others</span>. The powerful, heartfelt prayers of Miss Clara, beautifully portrayed by Karen Abercrombie, still echo in my soul. What a refreshing message to hear!!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Some Christians do not understand how powerful prayer is. This was an AWESOME faith-based movie that explains it in a way everyone can understand it. If anyone goes to see this movie needs to ask God to explain it to them if they do not understand. If you are not a Christian or do not believe in God you will not understand this move. This is perfect timing for a movie like this, due to all the negative things that are going on in our world today. <br />Christians need to stand tall on their knees praying for God to guide us each day and to pray for all our family, friends. and the peace of Jerusalem. I am a product of the power of prayer, and when God touched me, God showed me who was praying for me. In saying that, all I can say to you is prayer is very powerful, and the people you are praying for will be blessed.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This movie “War Room” has really helped me to pray more with God, and to just take the time to pray about my family and the whole world and people who I know. Another thing I learned was that prayer is very important, and it’s a powerful weapon. You know, God is listening to what you’re praying, and I know He will answer you. This movie “War Room” really touched me and strengthened my faith. I am very happy that I got to see this movie when it came out in theaters.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—I really enjoyed the movie, “War Room.” I must say that it was very realistic. Some comments are being made about a scene of alcohol use and attempted adultery. Those things are a part of the realistic world that we live in. That scene was a part of the movie to stress a point. Her husband was a liar, a thief, selfish, mental abuser and child/wife neglecting man who did not make God his number one priority. The husband and wife were both greedy and worldly and did not make God their number one priority. This is just as sinful as the alcohol and attempted adultery. <br />It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The humor and the seriousness of the movie was well balanced. It made me laugh and cry. The actors and actresses played their parts very well. <span>See all »</span><br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—As if you needed another positive comment, but I want to add that this movie was very well-written, and the acting was spectacular. The movie rotated entirely about marriage and praying for marriage, and the movie succeeded as cinematic art. I was interested throughout the whole movie. It disappeared quickly from my local theater, so I had to drive farther, but it was worth the drive.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This was a very inspiring, well made film within the faith-based movie genre. Our theater was sold out and, at the end, the place erupted into applause. It is encouraging to see this kind of support for these films, and the more we support them, the better they will become. The acting was similar to what we have come to expect from these faith-based films. Some of it is very good, and some is stiff and very amateur. What could have made this film much better was a script change. <br />My husband and I both agreed that the ending was much too sugar-coated and not realistic enough, diluting the potential for a stronger message. Early in the film Tony says that they can barely afford their beautiful home. After his confession, he is required to repay the $19,000, and he loses the company car then takes a job at half the pay. What is missing here is that they should have had to sell their house for a much more humble home (buying Miss Clara’s home would have made sense for example and added a sweet twist to the story with Miss Clara’s prayer room becoming Elizabeth’s), having to sacrifice more than just the loss of his car and his job. <span>See all »</span><br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—As a Christian man in his 40’s who likes action movies like Terminator and Avengers, I thought this movie was going to be the Bore Room. After all, I knew there would be no car chases, no explosions, and no super villains. I thought to myself, how could a movie about prayer possibly be any good? I reluctantly went to see it, though, because it was my wife’s birthday, and she wanted to see it. If it were left up to me, I would have waited for it to come out on DVD. I’m glad I didn’t however, because to my surprise, not only was it good, it was actually very good! It had great comedic moments, and a great story line. Even though it’s a PG movie, I would recommend that you can even take the kids.<br />If you’re looking for a place where you can have a great family night, the movie theater with “War Room” on the screen comes highly recommended!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div>—I went to see this today with my 16 year old grand-daughter who recently accepted the LORD. It is now my favorite movie. I also just responded to a well know secular film critic who does not like the Christian nature of the film, but that is what I like the most. This movie addresses what is a problem in most of our homes, including Christian ones. I pray that it will make warriors out of Christians, and Christians out of those who do not know the LORD. <br />As the founder of a ministry for abused men and women, I can confirm that what is depicted in this film is not fiction… it is very real. Jesus IS the answer to each of our problems, but we cannot just tell hurting people that… we have to show them how HE is the answer, and that may mean getting down and getting dirty to help them (No, I do not mean in a sinful way, by doing the things they do, but I mean really caring about those the world rejects.). <br />This film has a lot of humor in the right places and had the audience laughing several times, but, more important, I am sure it has many tears in praise to our LORD over what HE can do in the lives of those who use… The PRAYER ROOM!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This is exactly the kind of movie I would like to see much more of in theaters!

I was so uplifted both times that I viewed it! It’s definitely a great movie for the entire family. <br />I come from a family background of truly believing in the power of prayer, the move of God, and this movie touches all aspects of life. The timing is perfect for all that is going on in our world. I saw nothing negative about this movie, prayers from the heart will reach the heart!!

Prayer moves God; it doesn’t tell him what to do, because he already knows what is best for us. He is an ALMIGHTY GOD that knows ALL things. <br />It is hard to forgive, the longer we sit on it, the more it will eat up your soul, but when we CHOOSE to forgive, as we see in the movie, it turns things around.

When we got home we had to seriously look at our own prayer lives and where prayer fitted in with what we consider important in our spiritual growth and understanding God’s purpose for our lives. The movie also made it clear who are enemy is and the tools he uses to try and discourage us from following God. <br />I loved the part where Elizabeth, after praying, spent time just listening to God. In John 10:27 (NIV) it states, My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. What other religion can claim that kind of intimate relationship with their god or gods? The producers accomplished a lot in the two hour running time of the movie. <br />My only disappointment was that the movie <span>failed to realistically show the consequences of sin</span>. Forgiveness was handled beautifully, but I kept thinking that people might walk away with the idea that everything will work out just fine when we turn our lives over to Christ. We get to keep the expensive house, a new job will be offered to us, we don’t even have to apply anywhere, our children will instantly forgive us for the damaged we may have caused them, and as long as we admit to our employer that we stole, lied, and defrauded them that God will remove any really serious consequences. Biblically, that is seldom so. Although God can turn what was mean’t for evil into something good we are still responsible for our choices. <br />Still, a great movie, well acted, well written, with a great message, and a real challenge for us to place God first. Congratulations. I would recommend this movie to anyone desiring a closer relationship with God.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4½<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—It’s very inspiring, touching and has very good sense of humour.

However, each said after seeing it, it was one of the best movies they’d ever seen. The casting was perfect. Only one comment… You must change the title.

It really help me with my Spiritual Journey to make sure that I stay hot and not warm. I also learned I am not in control, and I can’t change people, to pray about things and leave it to GOD to fix it, because I can't no matter what I do. Also, after watching the film, my husband and I talked at home for about 2 hours about our issues and Spiritual Journey. We now have a better understanding.

I wanted to be more like Daniel and King David, who had very good communication with God. So this was an answer to prayer for me. After I saw War Room, I saw Alex Kendrick’s speech on youtube.com about the 3 Battles and was very impressed that he seemed to be a very committed follower of Jesus Christ. Then I heard about the Bible Study that I could buy at Lifeway.com “Battle Plan for Prayer.” It includes a book, Bible study book, and 2 DVD’s that have a total of 8 sessions on how to pray more effectively. I have learned a lot so far, and had more answered prayers since. It talks about what makes our prayer more effective and also less effective. This is what I was looking for! <br />Thank you Alex for all you do and may God Bless You! I am giving “War Room” DVD’s out to people whom I think would be willing to have people over to their house and watch it, or even share with their church, and develop a prayer ministry.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Saw it Christmas day.

I’ve never seen this movie before, so when I suggested that all the women put a letter to God in to a private place in your closet, one young lady stated to me did you see “War Room” I said no, she said I won’t say anything else, just look at it. <br />I ordered the movie, my husband and I watched the movie and Oh my God, was God talking to me or what, I was Ms. Clara, being stubborn, wouldn’t listen to God on praying for my husband, I’m asking God to help me, I will be turning my home office into my War Room.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Love this movie; it is now on my have to get movies.

I could not contain myself at times. The spirit was so high. I do agree that the outcomes could have been very different, as it is sometimes in real life. Nevertheless, we must hold to our faith, even if the situation does not initially seem to turn out on our behalf. The wife was ready to give up, but she held on. It may take years before we see the positive result we are looking for. But trusting God over the long run, I believe, will be our blessing like we never dreamed it could be. <br />I am currently waiting for the answer to a prayer I’ve prayed for over ten years. I confess I do get frustrated sometimes, but I remind myself that not only does God love me, but he promised to answer my prayer. So I suck it up and get back on the trail of faith. I am so thankful for a movie clearly advocating godliness.

There are some situations such as an abusive one where a person needs to just get out. In many ways, “War Room” is the typical fare from the Kendrick Brothers that a lot of people, myself included have enjoyed. One serious scene that was very well done was the scene where Elizabeth, the main character discovers how little she knows about her 10 year old daughter. One of the best funny scenes involves a conversation about eating chips in the closet. <br />The story played out as realistically as a movie can. Obviously, in real life, sometimes things do go badly wrong, but a movie generally has to have a happy ending. The only negatives I noted are a few scenes that felt like they’d been recycled from their previous movies and a strange scene where Elizabeth is going through her house shouting at the devil.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Good / Moviemaking quality: 3<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Really enjoyed this movie.

Thank you for saving my marriage.<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This movie has totally changed my life. It taught me what I was doing wrong in my prayer life. It taught me how to fight in the Spirit. I saw where I had been fighting wrong for so many years. This movies stirred up the warrior in me and has totally changed my life, and I’m going to take the role of Miss Clara, and, once God teaches me, I’m going to share with other people. I thank God for allowing this movie to be made, because it helped his daughter get her fight back.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—What a great movie for ANYONE going thru hard marriage challenges.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: <br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—Have watched this movie almost five times, but I can’t stop watching it, because even after a stressful day I just watch it. It has taught me to pray for my relationship and living a stress free life, leaving God to do His will in my life, because when you trust the power of prayer, things work out. Also praying for God’s grace always. What I have to say, this movie was purposely for me. Thanx. Anyone finding problems in his/her relationship, this is the best movie to watch. I really love it.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—I think they did an excellent job portraying many aspects of Christian living. First, that people get caught up in the mundane and fast track of life. When we are preoccupied with ourselves—we lose focus of God and our relationship becomes lukewarm… Everybody needs someone in the faith to encourage and walk alongside them—like Ms. Clara—the mentoring that took place not prevalent these days. <br />People are looking for this one film to speak to every issue relating to prayer—you can’t focus on the necessity and power of God and prayer without the prayers being answered. It would be confusing to do that Also, I think we all are products of our culture even though we are believers we are skeptical about the ability of God to answer prayers. Elizabeth had to get more real estate to sell… no one movie will do it all—It did it’s purpose—showed us that our relationship with God is important—and that God is interested and involved in our everyday concerns and desires! <br />There is a battle for control of us—Ephesians 6 tells us we are in a spiritual fight daily—the movie taught us that we can be more victorious when we pray… And if we are getting more unanswered than answered prayers, we may need t examine our motives/desires and see if they line up with God’s Word<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4<br /></div><div><span>Positive</span>—This movie changed my life; I have always believed in GOD and Jesus. But I have had struggles with issues and marriage, and I was going through a separation. I watched this movie because GOD wanted me to see it; he put it in my path! The first time I went to the theater, I was alone. The next night, I had to go again, so I took a friend also in need, paid her way. I went home cleaned out my closet. I began to follow Elizabeth’s steps, Clara’s steps, GOD’S steps… Later that week I returned to the movie theater again, this time with yet another friend in need… there are so many… <br />Within 2 weeks “of praying for myself and my husband,” he came home. I told him I had a movie I wanted to watch with him. When it got to the about to cheat scene! His eyes got as big as a deer in the headlights! You see, he had done exactly the same thing and got exactly the same reaction… picking! What a sign from GOD and a testimony story that not only does prayer work! GOD is very much alive and well and HE IS watching! He will bless you if you ask, he is listening! Prayer does work, but you must do it! It is another sign of truth, that GOD is real and HEAVEN is real and so is HELL! <br />If your marriage is in trouble, get this movie, do what it says and believe in the Lord! Thank You to the story writers and producers and creators if this film and the actors that so perfectly portraits the message from GOD to us all! Don’t stop making movies! Thank You GOD for everything! Raise Up Lord! Amen!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 5<br /></div><div>Neutral</div><div><span>Neutral</span>—I finally saw this on DVD, and, while for the most part its great, I am concerned about the message it gives people. ***SPOILER*** In the end, it makes it seem like anything you pray for comes true. Cheating husband stops, stealing from companies means no prison time, your life goes perfect, your job goes perfect, family is all perfect. In other words, God is a genie who grants you anything you want no matter what. <br />Now, we do know nothing is impossible with God, of course. And I realize it’s a movie about uplifting and your happiness. But the Bible does not say God is a genie and everything you pray for has a yes in return. Sometimes it’s maybe, sometimes it’s a wait and sometimes it’s a no. <br />This movie may make newer Christians think they are doing something wrong because their prayers are not getting yes answers. And it may turn them off to God if they get the impression he’s a genie, but they don’t get what they want. <br />It may also make people think if your husband cheats, he will never do it again if he realizes he was wrong. Or if you commit fraud at where you work, your boss will forgive you and let you off the hook. <br />With those points aside, it was a great movie and inspirational and making you think how much prayer matters. And how hard you should be praying. There is power in prayer!<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4<br /></div><div>Negative</div><div><span>Negative</span>—…I am a Christian who thought this was a dangerous movie, because the <span>implication is you can control God with prayer</span>, and he will control others. This bad doctrine helped me become suicidal when (the murderer and rapist) I was married to at the time wasn’t changing. I put oil on the door posts, prayer cloths under his pillow, was being told NOT TO JUDGE, that’s not in the Bible either (another bad doctrine that makes people crazy) that was in the movie, too. <br />True intercession is a man that will TELL THE TRUTH, not go in the closet and pray. That’s what numbers of people in churches did for this murderer when he needed to be locked up. This is why so many people in churches are dumbed down. …<span>See all »</span><br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Good / Moviemaking quality: 3½<br /></div><div><span>Negative</span>—I did view the movies after several people recommended it. I was watching and almost fell asleep. It was nothing like I thought it would be. It was another feel good message that offered no depth. I agree that things change in prayer. But I also believe in a time where people are looking for “How to”. This movie, in my opinion, offers false hope. I have been called to prayer and intercession at a high cost. I have lived in my prayer closet for @ 17 years. It’s not that simple. <span>See all »</span><br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Average / Moviemaking quality: 3<br /></div><div><span>Negative</span>—My wife and I have been going through many difficult trials over the past few years of our 21-plus years of marriage, and the current set of trials have been the most difficult of all. While I totally agree that prayer is powerful and aligns you with God's will, sometimes even the most pure and honest of prayers that you hope for will not be answered. As a husband, I have prayed for the past 11 years for God to provide me a job that would allow my wife to stay at home with our kids. Well, 11 years later, my kids are grown, my wife is still having to work full time and be the bread winner and no family-wage job for myself. <br />You would think something so pure as this—which is even Biblically based for a man to provide for his family and the wife to be at home to raise the children—would be answered. This, along with long bouts of unemployment, surgeries, bankruptcy and even unfaithfulness in the marriage, have all played pivotal moments in our marriage even when we were both praying individually and as a couple. <br />These films, while wonderful in concept, do not deal with the directness of actual life consequences (like what would have happened had this praying wife's prayers not been answered before the end of the movie? Had her husband, Tony, cheated on her and then, after being fired from his job, had gone to prison? What would have happened had they lost their home due to lack of income? <br />That the wife, Elizabeth, just said the heck with it all and ran off had her own emotional or physical affair? These are the real trials and consequences of life that hit us even when we do pray and pray fervently but do not receive the answers to the prayers that we send to God. God will work the ugliness and sin of life and, if we turn to Him, He will start to work things through for His good. I guess I am just jaded to the easiness of this movie and how quickly and completely these prayers are answered in such a short amount of time and how everyone lived happily ever after. <br />This isn't real life, this is a made up movie with wishful thinking that prayer works that fast and prayers are answered according to your desires. <br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: / Moviemaking quality: <br /></div><div><span>Negative</span>—I’m thinking this movie and “Fireproof” are feel good movies. They may help the immature Christian who is going through a rough patch to make it through another day. I felt vindicated watching this and was hoping that if my ex, who is a Christian, ever saw it that she would get a clue what might of happened if she would have stuck around. However, reality is that not everyone’s marriage gets healed, no matter how hard or how correctly a person prays. Mine wasn’t. <br />I’ve heard of people’s marriages being healed. But, Christians are allowed to make poor decisions. The Bible is filled with examples of poor decisions. The good news is that the Father can make good things come from poor decisions. God is fully able to change a wayward spouse’s mind by trials and tribulation. Faith is knowing that God can do anything, but you also have to trust Him even when He does not answer us the way we think He should. I would love it if every prodigal spouse came to their senses. <br />Anyway, I’m not trying to bum anyone out or make anyone’s faith fail, but, in my experiences, this is not realistic. I hope your marriage is saved. God bless.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Excellent! / Moviemaking quality: 4<br /></div><div><span>Negative</span>—I have a concern with Elizabeth rebuking Satan, though the scene is powerful, I don’t believe it’s biblical, even the archangel Michael didn’t rebuke Satan, instead he said “The Lord rebuke you” in Jude 1:9. Satan, first of all, is not omnipresent like God is, he can’t be in all places at all times, he’s just a fallen angel, so it’s a pointless exercise to rebuke him and to teach others to do so is not right; though I know we get spiritual attacks, but from other evil spirits/demons. <br />I think in the movie they misunderstand James 4:7-8—we must resist Satan and draw near to God, and He will draw near to us, not confront or command Satan. Satan may be cunning, manipulative and powerful his power doesn’t compare with God’s power, that’s why we lean on God, we draw near to Him and when we do Satan will have no power or authority over us except that which God gives him (Job 1:12). Let’s rather draw near to God and put our trust in Him—the battle really is not ours, it is the Lord’s.<br /><span>My Ratings:</span> Moral rating: Better than Average / Moviemaking quality: 4<br /></div><table width='100%' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0' border='0'><tbody><tr valign='bottom'><td width='33%'>Free Republic<br />Browse · Search</td><td align='right' width='33%'>General/Chat<br />Topics · Post Article</td></tr></tbody></table><font color='black' size='+1'><b>Steve Bannon's Warroom is SMOKING right now!
