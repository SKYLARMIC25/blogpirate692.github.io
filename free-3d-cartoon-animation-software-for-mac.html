animation has come a long way since inception in the year 1960. The fundamentals of animation software or animation tool can be traced back to the time when William Fetter, a computer graphics designer made a diagram of a human body inside an airplane cockpit. Although the intention was to maximize the efficiency of Boeing’s cockpits, it paved the way towards more sophisticated process flows and thus, towards animation generated by computers. The credit for the first animation software, however, goes to Ivan Sutherland, an MIT graduate. His program Sketchpad (developed in 1963) drew lines that looked like recognizable figures. Little did he know that his idea would become a multibillion-dollar industry in the years to come.<br /></p><ol><li><a href='#free-3d-cartoon-animation-software-for-mac-2020'>Free 3d Cartoon Animation Software For Mac 2020</a></li><li><a href='#free-3d-animation-software-mac'>Free 3d Animation Software Mac</a></li><li><a href='#free-mac-animation-software'>Free Mac Animation Software</a></li><li><a href='#free-3d-cartoon-animation-software-for-mac-10-7'>Free 3d Cartoon Animation Software For Mac 10 7</a></li></ol><p>Slowly and steadily, more progress was made in the field.
