The concrete originated from the JJ Mottes Concrete Company in Stafford Springs, Connecticut, during the years 1983 - 2015. The mineral is found in a Willington, Connecticut, quarry that no longer supplies aggregate for residential foundations. <br /></span><span>Pyrrhotite causes the slow deterioration of the concrete when exposed to oxygen and water. While the presence of pyrrhotite indicates the potential for concrete deterioration, its existence alone does not necessarily cause it. <br /></span></div><p><span>The cracking starts small and may take more than 10 years to over 30 years to appear. Horizontal cracks or cracks that splinter out like a web are the most concerning. A rust color residue or white powder may appear. The sheetrock walls of a finished basement may need to be removed to examine the concrete. As the concrete deteriorates, it often becomes structurally unsound. </span></p><p><span>The damage is irreversible. The repair is to fully replace the impacted foundation with a new foundation that does not contain pyrrhotite.</span></p><p><span>The State of Connecticut is providing financial assistance to homeowners who have a crumbling foundation, due to pyrrhotite, where the home, condo, Planned Unit Development, or home addition was built after January 1, 1983, and before December 31, 2015.</span></p><div><strong>Towns Identified by CRCOG as having been impacted by Crumbling Foundations</strong></div><p><span>Homeowners who suspect their foundation may be showing signs of cracking should have the foundation tested by a VISUAL test and/or a CORE test. At this time, the only test that can definitively confirm the presence of pyrrhotite is a CORE test. </span></p><ul><li><span>A <strong>VISUAL </strong>test is a licensed professional engineer’s (PE) expert opinion based on education, observation, and prior experience that the foundation’s cracking is due to incompatible materials in the concrete mix. This visual report describes the current condition of the concrete and cannot predict if un-cracked concrete will deteriorate at a later date.</span></li><li><span>A <strong>CORE</strong> test determines the presence, or absence, of pyrrhotite and the percent of pyrrhotite that exists in the sample. It requires drilling out a 4 inch diameter cylinder from the concrete which is sent to a lab for analysis. The concrete is plugged after the core sample is removed.</span></li></ul><p><span>The State of Connecticut is assisting homeowners, in the affected area, with the cost of testing their foundation.</span><span>Two opportunities for testing payment assistance are available.</span></p><p><span>I. </span>The State of Connecticut allocated $5 million to reimburse homeowners for the cost of testing their concrete foundation. The Capitol Region Council of Governments (CRCOG) is administering the program for the State of Connecticut.</p><img src='https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-crumbling-old-haunted-house-perfect-for-halloween-114216616.jpg' alt='Crumbling House' title='Crumbling House' /><p><span>Eligibility requirements for this program include: </span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Visual Inspections must be performed by a CT licensed professional engineer (PE).</strong></span></li><li><span>The home was built on or after January 1, 1983, and before December 31, 2015.</span></li><li><span>If the home was built before 1983, but an addition was constructed during the years 1983 to 2015, then the foundation of the addition is eligible for testing under the program. </span></li><li><span>The home is in Connecticut and within 20 miles radius of J.J. Mottes Concrete Company in Stafford Springs. A waiver application for homes outside of the 20 mile radius is available.</span></li><li><span>CORE Testing will be reimbursed at 50%, up to $2,000, for pyrrhotite testing of up to 2 core samples. </span></li><li><span>VISUAL inspection, performed by a CT licensed professional engineer (PE), will be reimbursed at 100% up to $400.</span></li><li><span>Homeowners are eligible for the program.</span></li></ul><p>Homeowners are eligible to receive reimbursement for <strong><span>both</span></strong> visual and core testing on the same property. However, each house is eligible for reimbursement for only one visual examination and one set of core tests.</p><p><span>For full details on the program and an application for reimbursement, visit: www.foundationtesting.org or contact CRCOG at </span>860-724-4277<span>.</span></p><p>II. The State of Connecticut, Department of Housing, through a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) has provided funding to eligible municipalities for a foundation testing program. A CDBG crumbling foundations testing program may cover 100% of the costs to test a foundation for pyrrhotite, up to $5,000. There may be other qualifiers. <strong>Residents should contact the town before arranging any testing.</strong></p><p><span>Residents in Ashford, Bolton, Columbia, Coventry, Ellington, Stafford, Tolland, Union, Vernon and Willington should apply directly to their town before they begin testing.</span></p><p><strong><span>REDUCTION IN PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT</span></strong></p><p><span>Connecticut Public Act 16-45 requires municipal assessors to inspect and reassess residential properties with foundations made from defective concrete at the property owner's request. To request this reassessment, contact your town and submit a written report by a CT licensed professional engineer (PE). The property must be inspected and its assessment adjusted within 90 days after the report has been submitted or the next assessment year, whichever is earlier.</span></p><h3>Crumbling Houses For Sale</h3><p><span>This new assessment is valid for 5 years or until the foundation is repaired or replaced, whichever is earlier. Homeowners who repair or replace the foundation have 30 days to notify the assessor in writing. The property must be inspected and reassessed by the town within 90 days of the notification or before the next assessment year, whichever is earlier.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSURANCE</span></strong></p><p><span>Insurance companies cannot cancel or refuse to renew a homeowner's policy due to a crumbling foundation.</span><span>If you believe this has happened to you, you should file a complaint with the Connecticut Insurance Department</span><span>or call the Connecticut Department of Insurance, Consumer Affairs Unit at 1-800-203-3447. </span></p><p><strong><br />LEGISLATION</strong></p><h3>Crumbling House Bricks</h3><p><strong><span>Summary of PA 18-179</span></strong></p><p><span>This bill codifies the residential disclosure report home sellers must provide to purchasers and expands what must be included in it.
